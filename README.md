# Distinguishing-Orthogonal-States

**For 1**
Input: A qubit which is guaranteed to be in either the $\ket {\psi_+}$ or the $\ket{\psi_-}$ state, where $\ket {\psi_+} = 0.6\ket 0 + 0.8 \ket 1$ and $\ket {\psi_-} = -0.8\ket 0 + 0.6 \ket 1$.

Output: true if the qubit was in the $\ket {\psi_+}$ state, or false if it was in the $\ket {\psi_-}$ state. The state of the qubit at the end of the operation does not matter.
